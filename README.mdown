gem2deb
====

Synopsis
----

    gem2deb <gem name> [<target package name>]

Description
-----

gem2deb will covert a ruby gem into a set of debian packages and a debian
changes file suitable for use with dupload.  In the synopsis above the gem name
is simply the name of a gem available via the gem command.  gem2deb fetches the
gem, unpacks it to a tmp directory and builds a set of debs out of it.

gem2deb will detect any dependencies declared in the gem and translate them
into debian dependencies of the form lib{gem}-ruby.  It is important to note
that underscores are not allowed in debian package names, therefore gem2deb
translates underscores into dashes when it creates gem packages and
dependencies.

Dependencies
-----

Requires the following debian packages: cdbs ruby-pkg-tools devscripts

Environment
-----

* DEPENDENCIES - Any extra runtime dependencies you would like to declare for a
  package.
* RULES - Adds arbitrary rules to the debian rules file.  Use this to hook into
  the debian build system and execute arbitrary actions during the package build.

Examples
-----

Package the thin gem:

    gem2deb thin

Package do_sqlite3 and set its dependency on sqlite3:

    env DEPENDENCIES="sqlite3" gem2deb do_sqlite3 libdo-sqlite3-ruby

Add files outside of the normal gem path for a build:

    env RULES="install/libmygem-ruby1.8\n\tmkdir -p /var/log/mylogdir" gem2deb mygem.gem
